Given a sorted array A of unique numbers, find the K-th missing number starting from the leftmost number of the array.

Example 1:
Input: A = [4,7,9,10], K = 1 Output: 5 Explanation: The first missing number is 5.

Example 2:
Input: A = [4,7,9,10], K = 3 Output: 8 Explanation: The missing numbers are [5,6,8,...], hence the third missing number is 8.
